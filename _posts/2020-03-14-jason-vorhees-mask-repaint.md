## The Idea
For Halloween 2019 I decided to dress up as Jason Vorhees, but the time I'd made up my mind, I only had a couple weeks to prepare. I also didn’t want to spend too much; nice costume pieces can get a little pricey for Jason. I decided to focus on repainting a cheap mask to look a more realistic and use basic costume pieces and a generic monster hood for the remainder. This post focuses on repainting the retail mask.
While I didn’t set out to make a movie-accurate replica, the mask was heavily inspired by the Part 3 and Part 4 looks.

## The Build 
This project was fairly straightforward and mostly centered on weathering the mask once the recognizable bits were painted in.

To start, I watched a few videos on YouTube for ideas on the process. The most useful video was [How To Make Friday The 13th Part 3 and 4 Jason Masks - DIY Painting Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLCxiqh_sBg). I really liked the scratching and weathering techniques covered, so I based most of the process below on this video. Thanks [Big Hush](https://www.youtube.com/user/BigHush)!

### Sanding and Prep
The first step was to sand away any clear coats and some of the paint from the retail paint job. Knowing primer was next, I didn’t get every bit of the old paint off, I mostly focused on making sure the plastic wasn’t damaged and removing any clear coats that may have been added at the factory.

### Priming
Next, I primed the mask with black and almond-colored spray paint primer (brands listed below). The black coat goes on first and the almond second, once the first has dried. The reason for priming in two colors is to give the mask those deep scratches during the weathering process. Those details are what first drew me to the video I linked above, I feel they sell the mask as being a real piece rather than just being a dirtied-up hockey mask.

Though it’s not critical, masking the top three snaps on the mask with painters tape will save you time in scraping later.

### Weathering and Chevrons

#### Scratches
I started the weathering process with the deep scratches. Given their importance to me, I wanted all other weathering to be built around the scratches. 

With a pencil, I outlined the scratch patterns on the mask. Since this isn’t a movie-accurate replica, I had some fun with scratch placement and embellished a little on the pattern covered in the video. A key scratch I wanted to sell the mask as Jason was the nose one- a staple in the Part 3 and Part 4 mask in the movies.

After outlining the scratch placement, I took a piece of rough sandpaper (80-120 grit) and slowly sanded away the primer. The two layers of primer work wonders when you sand away. The almond paint reveals black around the edges of the scratch and the more heavily-sanded areas reveal the white plastic of the mask itself. The effect looked even cooler in person than it did in the video. To really get some white to shine through, I folder the sandpaper and focused the pressure in the center of the scratch while trying to leave a good black line around the outline of the scratch.

#### Axe Chop
For the axe chop, I outlined cuts in pencil and used scissors to cut it out. The chop was mostly rectangular but I tried to make it look a bit jagged. Next was blood. I used red paint mixed with some blacks and browns to darken it up in spots. I also spotted black on once it had dried a bit to give it some depth. I tried to do the same with some fake blood, but it didn’t really have much effect beyond the paint. If you have some lying around, it’d be worth a try but I wouldn’t buy some just for that.

#### Chevrons
Most of the chevrons (the red hashes on the mask) in tutorials online use decals you either buy or cut yourself. They look nice and crisp, but I felt like they might make the mask look a bit off- the decals under the eventual clear coat could reflect light back differently than just the paint. I’m unsure what the canon says about the chevrons, whether they’re decals or hand-painted, but I knew I wanted hand-painted.

You might also notice that the mask only has half of the top chevron. Not all Jason masks are missing the top half, but Part 4 does and I liked the look, so I incorporated that into the design. Most of the chevron files I found online do come with the three complete chevrons, so you can make your own choice and be covered. 

My first attempt didn’t work out so well. What I tried was downloading a pattern for the chevrons online, using my Cricut to cut a stencil in card stock, and then using that stencil to paint them directly on the mask. The picture below is the result:

The lines needed to be crisp and thin, these were neither. What I’d change if I were to do it again, and my recommendation if you set out to make one, is to freehand the design in pencil and fill it in with a liner brush. The smoothest option would be to airbrush or even spray paint the chevrons on, but that method would require masking the chevrons. 

To try and save this mask, I attempted to match the spray paint color with my weathering paints and use a liner brush to reshape the chevrons a bit and clean them up. The cleaned chevrons are pictured below. They look decent from afar, but you can tell the colors don’t match up close. Thinking now as I write this, I _could_ have probably sprayed some of the primer into a cup and used that…

#### Weathering
I relied on two primary methods for weathering: sanding and paint washing. 

For sanding, I used pretty rough sandpaper (80-120 grit) to make scratches and pull bits of paint off. The paint came off pretty easily, so I tried to keep the effect subtle. As you can see, I got carried away in some spots. I also used an X-Acto knife to clean up some of the scratches and make them sharper, particularly in the mouth hole, nose, and chevron scratches. On the forehead I tried some steel wool, but it didn’t look anything like I was after (so avoid that). 

Once the base coats were weathered down to my liking (and then some), I slowly built up a dirtied look through paint washes with browns and black. I didn’t have a particular approach to dirtying the mask up beyond making sure to hit each of the mask holes and edges well. The rest was a lot of trial and error. Fortunately, it’s easy to pull back spots where things get too dirty with a little water.

## Final Result
With the painting complete, I sprayed a few layers of clear coat and let it dry to seal it. The gloss makes the mask look a bit more realistic and also highlighted some of the details well.

## What I’d Do Differently
Overall, the project went better than I expected it to and I’m pleased with the mask, especially for a first attempt. The two things I’d do differently if I tried making another mask are being more subtle with sanding while weathering and free-handing the chevrons in pencil rather than with a stencil. During weathering, I ended up rushing the sanding a bit and hit certain spots (like the forehead) way too much. The chevrons I made with the stencil came out sloppy and cleaning them up took a good amount of time and resulted in some discolored paint around the chevrons. It’s not super noticeable from a distance, but up close it’s clear. 

In the end, the project ended up much more accessible than I anticipated. I’m new to painting projects like this, so it was a good one to experiment without worrying about ruining the mask. I can’t recommend trying this out enough if you’re thinking of doing a Jason mask of your own - it was a fun time.
