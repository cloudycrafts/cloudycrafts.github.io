Creating Halloween yard decorations is something I’ve wanted to do for a long time, I but always found an excuse not to: it’ll take too much time, it’s too expensive, I waited to late into the year to start. Halloween 2019 was the year I changed that. 

After watching the Tested video [How To Make a Realistic Horror Skull Prop!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8w4hufoujg), I convinced myself  making some decorations wouldn’t be too hard. With a few weeks to go before Halloween, I decided to try to make a small graveyard in my front yard and fill it with bones. 

# Skulls
Following the instructions from the Tested video, I bought a bag of cheap bones to serve as the bases and covered them each with pieces of [cotton](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00J4OITME) and [liquid latex](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B011X3C8CK). I kept building up the surface until it looked more like bits of decayed body and compacted grime from being buried.

For the second skull, I used plumber’s putty to hold the mandible at a skewed angle like in the video.

Once dried, I dry brushed earthy tones and some bright reds on the bones until they looked good enough. It was my first attempt at painting anything seriously, but dispelled how inaccessible painting felt to me before.

# Graves
To create a small cemetery in the front yard, I created some crosses and gravestones out of Polystyrene foam insulation sheets. The pieces were cut out with a [foam cutter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07H28SCC9/),  epitaphs carved into the faces, wood grain gouged into them, and dry brushed with brown acrylic paint. 

I also dug a shallow grave for a full-size skeleton, to look like a grave robbing. Unfortunately, I didn’t have enough time to ‘corpse’ the full-size skeleton like the bones before Halloween night.

Overall, the decorations weren’t as extensive as I would have wanted, and there’s still quite a few unfinished bones and headstones, but it was the first time I’ve decorated my yard with more than store-bought decorations, which feels good.
